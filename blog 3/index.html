    <h1>Teen Accounts on Instagram Will Now Have their Apps Censored</h1>
    <p>By<b> Afaq Wajdan Malik </b>| Published Oct 15, 2025 | 1:31 pm</p>

    <p>Instagram is introducing a major update aimed at protecting teenage users by filtering their feed to display only
        content suitable for a PG-13 audience. The move, announced by Meta, comes in response to growing concerns about
        the platform‚Äôs influence on young users and will apply globally over the coming months.</p>

    <p>The update ensures that all accounts belonging to users under 18 are placed into a default ‚Äú13+‚Äù content setting.
        This setting limits access to posts with strong language, dangerous stunts, drug-related themes, and other
        mature material. Meta confirmed that even if teens try to search for such topics, the system will block not only
        the keywords but also common misspellings.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Meta plans to introduce a new ‚ÄúLimited Content‚Äù mode. This stricter option allows parents to decide
        what kind of posts their children can view, comment on, or interact with in messages. Teens cannot modify these
        settings without parental approval.</p>

    <p>Alongside this rollout, Instagram will use AI tools to identify users who misrepresent their age when signing up.
        This system will help move such users into the correct age-appropriate settings. The company has already
        implemented safety measures like private account defaults, content filtering, and notification restrictions at
        night, all of which will remain active</p>

<p>According to Meta, the update also includes a feature that prevents teens from following accounts known for regularly posting inappropriate content. If they already follow such pages, those connections will be blocked or removed.</p>

<p>The changes will first roll out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia before reaching other countries later this year.</p>
